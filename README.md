The Hardware (Screen comes terminals soldered, you can buy un soldered or pre-soldered RPI Pico versions.  Make sure to get a W (wireless) version.  RPI Pico 2 W should also work, but I do not have one to test.

The software is WIP, but currently connects to WiFi and gets SATORI and EVR balance from multiple addresses, as well as getting the time via NTP & displays on the screen.  

It needs aditional API's developed to display the version/neuron count/current stake
